Hi i'm Bathiya, currently studying and expanding my skills in full-stack development while already capable of delivering practical, real-world IT and web solutions.

I work confidently across IT infrastructure, system troubleshooting, networking, and hardware management, ensuring smooth and secure technology environments.

On the development side, I am actively learning and building modern applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, C#, Java, and MySQL, along with CMS platforms like WordPress, Shopify, and WooCommerce.

With a strong eye for design through Photoshop and Illustrator, I combine functionality with creativity to build clean, effective, and user-focused solutions.
